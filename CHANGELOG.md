### Added

- Works with Web Speech API provider without `resultIndex` in `SpeechRecognitionResultEvent`, by [@compulim](https://github.com/compulim), in PR [#86](https://github.com/compulim/react-dictate-button/pull/86)

### Fixed

- Fixed `dictate` event should dispatch before `end` event, by [@compulim](https://github.com/compulim), in PR [#XXX](https://github.com/compulim/react-dictate-button/pull/XXX)

### Changed

- Reduced React version requirement from 16.9.0 to 16.8.6, by [@compulim](https://github.com/compulim), in PR [#83](https://github.com/compulim/react-dictate-button/pull/83)

## [3.0.0] - 2025-01-31

### Added

- Added continuous mode support, by [@RushikeshGavali](https://github.com/RushikeshGavali) and [@compulim](https://github.com/compulim), in PR [#73](https://github.com/compulim/react-dictate-button/pull/73) and PR [#78](https://github.com/compulim/react-dictate-button/pull/78)
   - In continuous mode, `dictate` and `progress` events will only report the latest round of recognition
   - After `end`, the push button and checkbox will not be turned off automatically
   - When stopping the recognition, it will emit an `error` event of error `aborted`, this is the behavior same as in non-continuous mode
   - If the underlying Web Speech API implementation does not support continuous mode, it should work as if in interactive mode
