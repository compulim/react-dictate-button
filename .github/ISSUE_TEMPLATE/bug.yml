        Please write a minimal test case which fail the scenario with comments in [BDD format (given/when/then)](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/applying-bdd-acceptance-criteria-user-stories).

        To protect from regressions, once the issue is resolved, your test case will be added to [our test suite](../tree/main/packages/integration-test/).

        For your convenience, a basic test case is provided below. For advanced scenarios, please look at [our test suite](../tree/main/packages/integration-test/).
